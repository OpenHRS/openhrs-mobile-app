	<h5 style="text-align: center;"> What can I search? </h5>
	<p> Our search feature is equipped with Elasticsearch, which applies an inverted index on all our data. In other words, when you search, we return the best results! </p>

	<h5 style="text-align: center;"> What is this "Take a Picture" feature? </h5>
	<p> Simply take a picture of a sign like this one: </p>

	<img src="./assets/img/sign-example.png" height="40%" width="40%"> 

	<p>The relevant statute with more information will be provided to you. Pretty cool, huh? Note that your location will be asked for upon your first successful image scan. This will auto report the location of the sign you just took to our database for use with the "Laws Near Me" feature.
	</p>

	<h5 style="text-align: center;"> Okay, how about laws near me? Aren't all laws applicable regardless of where I'm at? </h5>
	<p> Yes, all laws are applicable, no matter where you are, but signs that have been successfully scanned near you will display. This is so you can be extra aware of laws that are near you. </p>
